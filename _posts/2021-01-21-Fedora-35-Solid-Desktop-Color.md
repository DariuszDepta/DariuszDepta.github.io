Fedora 35 has really interesting desktop backgound pictures. But I am used to have a solid background color.
To set the solid backgound color for desktop, issue the following commands:
```
$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri ''
$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background primary-color '#10199E'
```
